What is Functions? 
Functions is the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure, it should take some input and return of an output where there is some relationship input and output. to read more please click [onlink](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp)

Java Logical operators for example 

let x = 5;
let y = "5"
console.log(x==y);

<!-- console.log((x==y)&&(x !==y)); this will check is strictly equal to why, and not strickly equal to y --> 

if (responses == 'yes'){


} else if (response == 'Yes'){


<!-- true && True, || logical or either side have to be true, if false&&truth it wil get false, if false&&false it's define get false-->

let response = prompt("do you like Javascript?");
if(resonses=='yes' ||response == 'yes'}} response == 'yes' || response == 'y'|| respponse == 'y'){console.log('Huzzah!');

} else if ( reponses == 'no' || response == 'NO')


<!-- let all response to be lower case in consoles -->

let repsonse = prompt ("Do you like javascript?");
console.log("before converting:"+response);
response = response.toLoweCase

script src="app.js" how to have app.js???

structure of a functions:

function declaration, this is how to declare or define a function 

function addTwoNumbers(parameters){code to be executed} -> this is for  add two number 

function addTwoNumbers(number1,number2{
console.log(number1 + number2);
}

addTwoNumbers(1+2);

function getName(   ){
let userName = prompt("What is your name?");
