## Growth Mindsets in my own words and ~~alot of words~~

Something about me: My current role is at banking industry, I'm graduated from University of Washington, I'm a full time mom and wife, I'm part time as operations manager. I have a home I need to takecare of but I have failed:cry: and run into many bad things in my life:boom::boom::boom:!!!!! I never have day off while I was in my associate and bachelor. I was near death give birth to my daughter:bomb:, I was on my knee in search the love of my life:vomiting_face:. BUT I DIDN"T GIVE UP take it on more challenges :100::100::100::100:

_3 reminders to remind myself_
- reminder 1 _Grow from Mistake_
- reminder 2 _Don't give up under any condition and circumstances_
- reminder 3 _Prepare to fail, then lit up again_
