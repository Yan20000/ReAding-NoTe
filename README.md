## Growth Mindsets in my own words and ~~alot of words~~

Something about me: My current role is at banking industry,previously University of Washington. In my personal time, I'm a full time mom and wife. I have a home I need to takecare of, but I love constant challenge and growth in my career, so I join Codefellows to learn coding. 

_3 reminders to remind myself_
- reminder 1 _Grow from Mistake_
- reminder 2 _Don't give up under any condition and circumstances_
- reminder 3 _Prepare to fail, then lit up again_
